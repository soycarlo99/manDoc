# manDoc

Welcome to **manDoc** â€“ a collection of documentation and manuals for programming languages and tools! We noticed that there wasn't a single website aggregating all the essential documentation links in one place, so we decided to build one. 

## About

manDoc is a community-driven project aimed at providing easy access to documentation for a wide range of programming languages and tools. Our goal is to create a comprehensive resource that developers can rely on for quick reference and learning.

## Contributing

If you think something is missing or outdated, don't hesitate to contribute! You can easily add new documentation links to our collection. Simply fork the repository, update the `docsData.js` file with your additions, and submit a pull request.

### How to Add a New Entry

To add a new documentation entry, use the following template:

```js
{
  name: 'Your Language/Tool Name',
  deviconClass: 'appropriate-devicon-class',
  url: 'https://link-to-the-documentation',
},
```

Place your new entry in the `docsList` array inside the `docsData.js` file. Make sure to follow the existing format to maintain consistency.
